Question 2a: Declaring an interface in C++ is just declaring an abstract class with pure virtual functions.

Question 3a: This is interface inheritance
Question 3b: These member variables should be private

Question 4: For my test cases, I made a vector of chars and then wrote that into the newly made TextFile. I then cout-ed the getName()
function and did the read() function on the TextFile. Both worked as expected. I then did append() using the same vector of chars and 
that also worked as expected.

Question 5: I first had to change the AbstractFile header functions to all virtual and = 0. Then, in the main, I made an AbstractFile
pointer equal to a new TextFile with the desired name.
