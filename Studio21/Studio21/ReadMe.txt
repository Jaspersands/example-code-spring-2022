Question 1: Jasper and Ethan
Question 2: The virtual destructor in the base class helps the compiler associate the derived and base class destructors.
Question 3: Dependency injection makes the command prompt more flexible and reusable because it doesn’t need to know each and every
concrete class it interacts with. Rather, it just needs to know what to do with what it's given. You can change the dependencies of the
command prompt without having to drastically change the command prompt itself.
Question 4: I tested this by making a factory, system, and touch command. I then made a command prompt configured to those three things.
From there, I ran the commandprompt and tested quitting, help, running the command, running a nonexistent command, getting help on a
nonexistent command, and inputting a command with additional input after it.
