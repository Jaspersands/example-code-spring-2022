Question 1: Ethan and Jasper
Question 2: to test the new read function I used a text file and an image file. Both built and
ran with no errors though because there is no printing in the read function, I only assume the 
vector<char> is correct.
Question 3: It will go from the file, to the visitor object from the accept method, then onto
the screen through the display visitor object
Question 4: It uses delegation by delegating similar methods for different file types to the
same definition in the header file making the interface far less cluttered with defintions for
eahc individual type
Question 5: A negative consequence of the visitor pattern is that when there are a lot of visitors and you want to add a new visitable 
concrete file type type, you'll have to modify every one of the visitor classes which could take a lot of time.
