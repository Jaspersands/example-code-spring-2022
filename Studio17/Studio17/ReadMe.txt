Answer the studio 17 questions here.
Question 1: Jasper and Ethan
Question 2: To test ImageFile, we made a char vector to write to the file, and then couted the getsize and getname methods. Then 
			we read the file to print it out.
Question 3: When programming a client to use an interface rather than a concrete class, the client doesn't have to 
			worry about any changes in the concrete classes or additional concrete classes. This can help lead to 
			longevity in code in the sense that as long as the interface and overall purpose of the code stays the same,
			the implementation can be changed.
Question 4: You would add the code to the createFile method of SimpleFileSystem.cpp essentially as another else if statement for a
			different file name ending.
